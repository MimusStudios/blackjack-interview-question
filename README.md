# Mimus Studios Blackjack Interview Question
Thank you so much for considering interviewing as a Software Developer at Mimus Studios. We pride ourselves in efficient, powerful, and creative problem-solving. As the majority of development right now is in the SugarCube 2 environment, this interview will be a practical test in that regard.

Note this interview is for a paid position. Volunteers do not need to complete this, just a an informal interview with Mimus.

In this take-home interview question, you'll be developing a simple game of [Blackjack](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) without the added complexity of splitting or doubling down a bet. There will be no bet involved, and it'll simply be a single round of win or lose.

## Setting up the environment
All devs need a developing environment for their code, for short we call this an IDE. For the purposes of developing in SugarCube you'll be using VSCode. The Twine editor will only build bad habits, and we at Mimus Studios want to avoid that.

You should start by downloading and installing [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Next you're going to want to install [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
Finally you want to install the [VSCode extension for Tweego](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cyrusfirheir.twee3-language-tools).
If you need help with any of the above steps please DM Mimus for help.

## Pull the Repository
Next, you want to pull this repository. You can do this by inputting this line into bash, terminal, or whatever other interface you use for Git. If you have trouble doing this, look up some tutorials online. Git is essential for any real development project.

    git clone https://github.com/MimusStudios/blackjack-interview-question.git

Then open the folder up in VSCode.

## Build the Code
All the necesary setup has already been done for you. Make sure you can hit `CTRL + SHIFT + B` in VSCode. The output to the code should appear in the folder as interview.html.

## Familiarize Yourself with SugarCube 2
When development first started at Mimus Studios, no developers knew any SugarCube 2, CSS, HTML, or Javascript. But as developers, we are expected to learn on the fly via [Documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/), code examples, and of course, Googling.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this interview is to not only assess your ability to work within a predefined environment, but to also assess your creativity, ability to learn, and tenacity. The problem is as follows: Implement a simple, single-round Blackjack game without the need for doubling down or splitting. The only requirements are that the game is playable; and that the assets under `resources/images/deck` are somehow utilized. All other details are up to your discretion, and we hope that allowing such freedom can allow you to exibit your skillset and creativity to us.

## Scoring
The scoring of this question will be holistic in nature. What we are looking for is clean and efficient code, proper comments and documentation, and some effort into UI design / optimization.

## Final Notes
There is no timeline on this interview, and if it takes you weeks that's fine as well. The point is that this question will expose you to the necesary skillset required to be a developer at Mimus Studios, and we wholely support guiding you along the way so that you can learn as well! Good luck, and please do not share code or collaborate with others. Also please utilize Google and the internet to the best of your abilities.

Finally, Mimus Studios encourages learning so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
